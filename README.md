## Misc

This is my first dive into creating a theme, so if you see something missing, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/sidwebworks/lone-wolf-dark/issues)! I'm sure there are things I missed.

Any relevant changes for each version are documented in the changelog. Please update and check the changelog before filing any issues, as they may have already been taken care of.

This palette was inspired in part by Night Owl [Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl).
